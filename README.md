C++ Projecrs for CS-210 (Programming Languages @ SNHU)
Plesse see different braches for projects.

In the current branch, I have uploaded my Corner Grocer code for project 3.

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is based on writing code for a grocery store.  The grocery store wants to be able to upload a daily collected summary of customers' purchases and be able to export a backup file, and also   determine the frequency of each item that is purchased.

2) What did you do particularly well?
I accomplished the task.  I created code that functions well, is memory safe (used vectors) and secure code (used OOP classes).

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I don't think I could enhance what I've created in terms of security.  I wrote the code using OOP principles (classes with public and private entities).  I could make the code more using more complex C++ coding techniques, like pointers.
   
4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the code fairly challenging to write in general.  It took me a bit to work through it.  What finally worked for me was looking through Zybooks and thinking logically through the challenge.  Also stepping the code line-by-line.

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Well, I really found my stride with OOP in this course.  I feel that I really started to get the concepts in this course.  Likewise, because C/C++ are the origin languages of many of the other popular OOP languages, any skills I have learned in this course are readily transferable.

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
One class system, vectors in the class system, and a minimal main.
